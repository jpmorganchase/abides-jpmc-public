    """The SparseMeanRevertingOracle produces a fundamental value time series for
    each requested symbol, and provides noisy observations of the fundamental
    value upon agent request.  This "sparse discrete" fundamental uses a
    combination of two processes to produce relatively realistic synthetic
    "values": a continuous mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process plus
    periodic "megashocks" which arrive following a Poisson process and have
    magnitude drawn from a bimodal normal distribution (overall mean zero,
    but with modes well away from zero).  This is necessary because OU itself
    is a single noisy return to the mean (from a perturbed initial state)
    that does not then depart the mean except in terms of minor "noise".

    Historical dates are effectively meaningless to this oracle.  It is driven by
    the numpy random number seed contained within the experimental config file.
    This oracle uses the nanoseconds portion of the current simulation time as
    discrete "time steps".

    This version of the MeanRevertingOracle expects agent activity to be spread
    across a large amount of time, with relatively sparse activity.  That is,
    agents each acting at realistic "retail" intervals, on the order of seconds
    or minutes, spread out across the day.
